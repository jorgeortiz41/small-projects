	- THIS IS AN OPTIONAL TOOL FOR ADDING PIXEL EFFECTS.


If you find any Pixel effect interesting to use then follow these instructions:

 . The Images folder has a boolean called "processPixelSheet" and it's set to false.
 . This boolean tells the program to either run or not run a method called PrintCropList()
 . This method needs to be given:
 	1. The Array that will contain the frames.
 	2. The Sheet that contains the frame images. (Each pixel effect has one called spritesheet.png)
 	3. And the designated coordinates for each frame to be "cropped" individually. These coordinates
 			are called "spritesheet.txt" and by clicking it you'll see all the frame coordinates.
 			Place this file in the /EffectCrops package, and in the PrintCropList's respective parameter
 			give it the String "/EffectCrops/THESPRITESHEETS'NAME.TXT" (usually this coord data is named spritesheet.txt
 	4. Give it the width and height at the last two parameters (usually 50,50 but check in the Coordinate txt
 	5. Now when you start, the console will print the frames like this:
 		"FireSkill[69] = fireSkillSheet.crop( 0, 0, 50, 50);"
 	6. Copy/Paste it in the code like the other Pixel Effects.
 	
 	*These pixel effects haven't been ALL tested with the PrintCropList() algorithm. If it is the case that
 	the coordinates are printed incorrectly then the algorithm provides proper examples if you wish to fix it.*
